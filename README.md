# hacker-rank
This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from HackerRank.

## Challenges
Challenges can be found in the subfolders, such as the `Algorithms` folder.

## Utilities
There are also some utilities, to make it easier to work with the challenge data provided by HackerRank.

### TestCases
The `TestCases` utility is used to read test cases downloaded from HackerRank.
It expects that there are two folders, `input` and `output`, inside the directory of the Challenge.
Inside those folders, there should be test files labelled `inputXX.txt` or `outputXX.txt`.

## Implementations
The following technologies are currently in use:
* F#
* .NET Core
* xUnit
* NuGet
